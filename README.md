## Reflections

### 1. **SECJ1014 Programming Technique II**
- **What I Gained**:  
  In this course, I further developed my programming skills in C++ and expanded my knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP). I learned about classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other core OOP principles that will help me create more efficient and modular code. Understanding these concepts has enabled me to build better software solutions and tackle more complex coding challenges.
  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  While the course provided solid theoretical knowledge, I believe there could be more focus on practical exercises and real-world projects. More in-depth examples of using OOP principles in larger projects would help reinforce these concepts.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  This course sparked my interest in learning more about software design and architecture. It’s clear to me now how OOP can make code more organized, reusable, and scalable. I look forward to using these principles in future projects.

### 2. **Database**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course taught me the fundamentals of database management systems (DBMS), including how to design relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and ensure data integrity. It also helped me understand the importance of normalization and indexing to improve database performance. This knowledge is especially useful in my project to improve the MyUTM portal, where I applied these concepts to optimize the database.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  One area for improvement would be more hands-on practice with different database management systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases. This would give students a broader perspective and help them choose the right DBMS for specific use cases.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  I found working with databases to be extremely rewarding. I now appreciate the importance of efficient database design, especially for web applications where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly and accurately. I’m excited to explore more advanced topics like database optimization and cloud databases.

### 3. **Network Communication**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course deepened my understanding of computer networks, focusing on protocols, IP addressing, routing, and network security. I gained hands-on experience in setting up and troubleshooting network connections. I also learned about different layers of network architecture (e.g., OSI model) and how data transmission works over various network types.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  I would suggest adding more practical exercises where students configure networks and simulate real-world networking scenarios. Lab exercises and group projects involving network setups and troubleshooting would greatly enhance the learning experience.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  The course gave me a newfound appreciation for the complexities of modern networks. Learning about network security and encryption was particularly insightful, as it is critical in today’s world where cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving. I look forward to applying these concepts to secure communication systems in future projects.

### 4. **Technology and Information System**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course provided valuable insights into how information systems are designed, managed, and implemented in organizations. I learned about workflow management, the role of technology in decision-making, and how information systems can streamline operations. My project to improve the MyUTM portal is a direct application of the concepts learned in this course, particularly in terms of database integration and system optimization.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  The course could benefit from more real-world case studies that demonstrate how organizations have implemented and benefited from information systems. This would help contextualize the theoretical concepts and make them more relatable.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  Working on my project for the MyUTM portal has been an eye-opening experience. It allowed me to apply the knowledge gained from this course and gave me a better understanding of the practical challenges involved in designing and optimizing information systems for large-scale use.

### 5. **Integrity and Anti-Corruption**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course helped me understand the ethical and legal challenges faced by professionals in technology and business fields. I learned about the importance of integrity in both personal and professional life, and the need for policies that prevent corruption and unethical behavior. The course emphasized the role of technology in supporting transparency and accountability.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  To improve the course, I would suggest incorporating more discussions on real-world cases where technology has played a key role in preventing or addressing corruption. Case studies would make the concepts more tangible and allow students to see how they can be applied in practice.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  This course has made me more conscious of the ethical responsibilities that come with working in technology. I now recognize that as I move forward in my career, maintaining integrity and adhering to ethical standards will be just as important as technical expertise. I’m motivated to use my skills in ways that positively impact society.
