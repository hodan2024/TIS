## Reflections

### 1. **Programming Technique II**
- **What I Gained**:  
  In this course, I further developed my programming skills in C++ and expanded my knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP). I learned about classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other core OOP principles that will help me create more efficient and modular code. Understanding these concepts has enabled me to build better software solutions and tackle more complex coding challenges.
  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  While the course provided solid theoretical knowledge, I believe there could be more focus on practical exercises and real-world projects. More in-depth examples of using OOP principles in larger projects would help reinforce these concepts.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  As a first-year student, this course has been a real eye-opener for me. I had no idea that programming could be so structured and powerful! Learning OOP made programming feel more organized and manageable, and I feel more confident about writing clean and scalable code. I look forward to diving deeper into coding as I progress in my studies.

### 2. **Database**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course taught me the fundamentals of database management systems (DBMS), including how to design relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and ensure data integrity. It also helped me understand the importance of normalization and indexing to improve database performance. This knowledge is especially useful in my project to improve the MyUTM portal, where I applied these concepts to optimize the database.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  One area for improvement would be more hands-on practice with different database management systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases. This would give students a broader perspective and help them choose the right DBMS for specific use cases.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  This was my first time working with databases, and it felt like a whole new world! I was amazed at how powerful databases are for storing and retrieving data efficiently. I still have a lot to learn, but I’m excited to use this knowledge in future projects, especially as I continue to develop my skills in web development and application design.

### 3. **Network Communication**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course deepened my understanding of computer networks, focusing on protocols, IP addressing, routing, and network security. I gained hands-on experience about UTP Cabelling, wire shark and packet tracer. I also learned about different layers of network architecture (e.g., OSI model) and how data transmission works over various network types.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  I would suggest adding more practical exercises where students configure networks and simulate real-world networking scenarios. Lab exercises and group projects involving network setups and troubleshooting would greatly enhance the learning experience.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  I never realized how much goes on behind the scenes when we use the internet! This course opened my eyes to how networks work and how important they are for communication. I’m still wrapping my head around some of the technical details, but I’m excited to learn more as I continue my studies.

### 4. **Technology and Information System**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course provided valuable insights such as software,hardware,information flow,security, ethics and cloud computing.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  The course could benefit from more real-world case studies that demonstrate how organizations have implemented and benefited from information systems. This would help contextualize the theoretical concepts and make them more relatable.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  I never thought about how systems and technology are used behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly in an organization. This course helped me understand the bigger picture of how information systems work. The mindsync project made me realize how much impact technology can have on improving efficiency, and I’m excited to apply these ideas to other real-world problems.

### 5. **Integrity and Anti-Corruption**
- **What I Gained**:  
  This course helped me understand the ethical and legal challenges faced by professionals in technology and business fields. I learned about the importance of integrity in both personal and professional life, and the need for policies that prevent corruption and unethical behavior. The course emphasized the role of technology in supporting transparency and accountability.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
  To improve the course, I would suggest incorporating more discussions on real-world cases where technology has played a key role in preventing or addressing corruption. Case studies would make the concepts more tangible and allow students to see how they can be applied in practice.

- **Additional Reflection**:  
  This course made me realize how important it is to stay ethical, especially as a technology professional. I’ve always known integrity is important, but now I see how easily it can be compromised in the tech world. I feel more motivated to make sure that whatever I do in my career, I stay true to my values and help make the world a better place through technology.
